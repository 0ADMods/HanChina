# Han China
This mod adds the *Han China* civilization to *0 A.D. Empires Ascendant*.

The Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (AD 220–280). It is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and China made significant progress in arts and sciences during the Han period. The core of the Han empire was around the Wei River, and the Han capital was Chang'an, very close to the Qin capital Xianyang (both are now part of Xi'an, Shaanxi).
